These systems are designed to deploy in response to certain types of collisions, mitigating the risk of serious injuries to passengers. The demand for airbags has been driven by increasing regulatory requirements for vehicle safety, coupled with rising consumer awareness about the importance of safety features in automobiles. Innovations in airbag technology, including side airbags, curtain airbags, and knee airbags, have further expanded their application, ensuring a higher level of protection for passengers in different crash scenarios. As the global vehicle fleet grows, especially in emerging markets, the adoption of airbag systems is expected to continue rising, driving significant growth in the market for passive safety systems. </p><p>Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) are also complementing the use of airbags by enhancing overall vehicle safety. However, airbags remain a crucial passive safety measure that works independently of active systems to safeguard occupants when a crash is unavoidable. The expansion of electric and autonomous vehicles, which necessitate new configurations for passive safety systems, is expected to lead to continued innovations in airbag technology. These developments, combined with stricter safety regulations across regions, are anticipated to bolster the light vehicle passive safety systems market, making airbags a key application segment for growth.</p><h2>Global Light Vehicle Passive Safety Systems Market by Application: Seatbelts</h2><p>Seatbelts remain one of the most fundamental passive safety systems in light vehicles, designed to protect occupants by preventing excessive movement during collisions.
